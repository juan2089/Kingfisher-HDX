Kingfisher HDX-MS is an app developed by JuaNolan at Washington University in St. Louis

We are regular HDX-MS users who got tired of relying on commercial software to analyze HDX data and create high quality representation of our results.

Our objective is to provide an open-source code to help every HDX-MS user in their statistical analysis and representation of the data. Our app provides several representations for the HDX results giving the users many options to fulfill their needs. Since the code is publicly available, we encourage the users to download it in their personal computers and modify it to satisfy their specific needs. This app was written in R (programming language and free software) to make sure every user can access it.
This app performs an automated workflow to statistically analyze HDX data using a hybrid significant test as published by Hageman and Weis in 2019 (link). The input file is either the output file of HDExaminer, the output file of Dynamix or a csv file formatted as described below. After the analysis is done, you can download several different representations of your HDX-MS data and an excel spreadsheet with all the results in it. Following the recommendations of the HDX-MS community published in Nat Methods 16, 2019, we suggest the users to include most of the representation given by this app as supporting information to ease the understanding of the data.

If you use our app, please cite our manuscript (submitted?) and let us know what you think via Twitter.

TUTORIAL/INSTRUCTIONS:

This app is composed of 10 tabs that you can access through the left panel. Most of the tabs will be empty until you upload your data.
